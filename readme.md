# Code Challenge

# Instruction

1. Please submit your application along with the solutions attached or linked.
2. Each problem provides sufficient information for you to attempt the challenge. If you have any uncertainties, you can note them in your solution and declare any assumptions if necessary.
3. It is important that you minimally attempt the problems, even if you do not arrive at a working solution.
4. With the advent of ChatGPT, the challenge is designed with broader scope and more freeform, so feel free to exercise your creativity where constraints are not clear.

<aside>
üí° **Start with the skeletal template in the GitHub repo linked below.**

1. You can either provide a link to an online repository, attach the solution in your application, or whichever method you prefer.
2. We're cool as long as we can view your solution without any pain (having to unzip a file is considered painful).
3. Depending on the role you are applying for, you may need to attempt only selected problems indicated below.

# Problems

‚ö†Ô∏è S**elect the appropriate *tab* below** for the role you are applying**.**

Depending on the role you are applying for, you may not need to attempt all the questions.

- üí° If you are applying as a Full-Stack Engineer to ‚Äútry the role‚Äù or ‚Äúdo some backend stuff‚Äù.
    
    You are recommended to apply instead for either Frontend or Backend, then ask for opportunities to work on the other fields. This avoids disappointment when the task assigned goes beyond your existing competency/experience.
