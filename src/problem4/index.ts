/**
 * Complexity: O(n)
 * Explanation:
 * - This function iterates from 1 to `num` using a `for` loop.
 * - It initializes `sum` as 0.
 * - The loop runs from `1` to `num` (inclusive), adding each number to `sum`.
 * - Since the loop executes `n` iterations, the time complexity is **O(n)**.
 * - Space complexity is **O(1)** because it only uses a few extra variables.

Function: sum_to_n_a
- Complexity: O(n)
- Explanation:
  - Iterates from 1 to num using a loop.
  - Each iteration adds the current number to sum.
  - Runs 'n' iterations, so complexity is O(n).
  - Space complexity is O(1) since it uses only a few variables.

/**
 * Complexity: O(n/2) â‰ˆ O(n)
 * Explanation:
 * - Instead of summing all numbers sequentially, this function pairs numbers:
 *   (1, num), (2, num-1), (3, num-2), and so on.
 * - It adds the first and last numbers in each iteration.
 * - The loop runs until `start` and `end` meet in the middle.
 * - The number of iterations is approximately `n/2`, but in Big-O notation, we drop constants, so it's still **O(n)**.
 * - Space complexity remains **O(1)** since it only uses a few variables.

 * Complexity: O(1)
 * Explanation:
 * - Uses the mathematical formula for summing the first `n` natural numbers:

 * - This formula computes the sum in **constant time**, regardless of the value of `n`.
 * - There are **no loops or recursive calls**, meaning the number of operations does not depend on `n`.
