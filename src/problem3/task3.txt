1./ List out the computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns found in the code block below.

** Summary **
- The children prop is destructured from props but never used. If it's not needed, you can remove it.
- Use blockchain property not exist in interface "WalletBalance". I can add blockchain property into interface "WalletBalance"
- Many functions or components are not defined, I guess it must be imported from somewhere.
- Use variables when not declared. I can declare varible before used to it
- Assign a specific interface "blockchainProp" instead of use "any" type
- Unnecessary formattedBalances: The creation of the formattedBalances array introduces overhead. The toFixed() formatting can be done directly when rendering the rows.
- Repeat the function getPriority many times
- Price value is in dependency of useMemo not need, because callback of useMemo not use value price and does not affect the callback process
