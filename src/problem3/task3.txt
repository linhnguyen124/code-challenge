1./ List out the computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns found in the code block below.

** Summary **
- The children prop is destructured from props but never used. If it's not needed, you can remove it.
- Use blockchain property not exist in interface "WalletBalance". I can add blockchain property into interface "WalletBalance"
- Use variables when not declared. I can declare varible before used to it
- Assign a specific interface "blockchainProp" instead of use "any" type
