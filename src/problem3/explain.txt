#Line 13: 
    Destructuring children and the rest of the props is unnecessary since they're 
    not directly used within the component.

#Line 34 to line 55: 
    The filtering logic in useMemo can be simplified by filtering
    out balances with zero or negative amounts directly in the initial balances.filter 
    call. This avoids the redundant check for lhsPriority being greater than -99.

    The sorting logic in useMemo can be optimized by returning early if leftPriority 
    equals rightPriority. This avoids unnecessary comparisons when priorities are the same.

#Line 57 to 62
    the spread operator (...balance) is not needed since the object properties are being
    directly assigned new values.
    formatted property is directly calculated so create formattedBalances is redundant.
