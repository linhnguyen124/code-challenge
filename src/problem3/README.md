# The code has some inefficiencies and anti-patterns. Here’s a breakdown:

## Issues:

1. Inefficient Filtering & Sorting in useMemo:

- The function first filters the balances and then sorts them. This causes unnecessary operations on the array.
- Sorting could be optimized to avoid redundant calls to getPriority.

2. getPriority Should Use a Map Instead of a Switch:

- The function can be optimized by using a dictionary lookup instead of a switch statement.

3. Avoid Excessive useMemo Usage:

- If balances and prices don’t change frequently, using useMemo may add unnecessary complexity.

## Improvements:

- Replaced switch with a dictionary lookup for better performance and readability.
- Combined filter & sort efficiently to minimize unnecessary operations.
- Removed redundant dependencies in useMemo for better optimization.

This should enhance performance and maintainability.
