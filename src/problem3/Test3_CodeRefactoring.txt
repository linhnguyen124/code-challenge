Computational Inefficiencies and Anti-patterns in the Code Block
- Use of useMemo with multiple dependencies:
	The useMemo hook recalculates the sorted balances whenever balances or prices change, which might be unnecessary if prices don't 	directly impact the sorting.
	Improvement: Separate the logic for filtering and sorting to minimize recalculations.

- Nested function calls within useMemo:
	The filter and sort functions are nested, making the code harder to read and debug.
	Improvement: Break down the logic into smaller, reusable functions.

- Incorrect condition logic:
	The condition lhsPriority > -99 should be balancePriority > -99 and balance.amount <= 0 is included within if unnecessarily.
	Improvement: Correct the condition logic to properly filter balances.

- Using any type for blockchain:
	Using any type undermines TypeScript's type safety.
	Improvement: Define a proper type for blockchain.

- Duplicated mapping over sortedBalances:
	Mapping over sortedBalances twice can be avoided for better performance.
	Improvement: Combine mapping and transformation in a single pass.
