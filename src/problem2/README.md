# Getting Started with the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on.
If the package has a package-lock, or an npm shrinkwrap file, or a yarn lock file, the installation of dependencies will be driven by that.

### `npm run dev` or `vite`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
